        <p>Malaysia is a mix of the modern world and a developing nation. With its investment in the high technology
          industries and moderate oil wealth, it has become one of the richest nations in Southeast Asia. Malaysia, for
          most visitors, presents a happy mix: there is high-tech infrastructure and things generally work well and more
          or less on schedule, but prices remain more reasonable than, say, Singapore.</p>

        <p class="text-warning text-capitalize">I have visited on (15/3/2024)</p>
        <p>The region was earlier known as Ottakal Mandu, with Otha-Cal meaning "single stone" in Tamil, a reference to
          a sacred stone revered by the local Toda people and Mandu, a Toda word for "village".[4] This later became
          Udhagamandalam which was anglicised to Ootacamund by the British, with the first part of the name (Ootaca), a
          corruption of the local name for the region and the second part (Mand), a shortening of the local Toda word
          Mandu.[5] The first known written mention of the place is given as Wotokymund in a letter dated to March 1821
          written to the Madras Gazette from an unknown correspondent.[6] Ootacamund was later shortened to Ooty. Ooty
          is in the Nilgiri hills, meaning the "blue mountains", so named due to the Kurunji flower which used to give
          the slopes a bluish tinge.</p>
